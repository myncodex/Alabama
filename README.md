This is a python program that was written to calculate the activity scores of students in a class.

The program uses input from the Rfid module to verify the identity of the student by reading the id card, Once a student has verified it downloads the activity certificates from google drive.

Google drive link must be shared before the students, the google drive link contains individual folders for students to upload their activity certificates.

Once verified, all the activity certificates will be downloaded from the student's folder and the algorithm calculates the activity points of all the certificates accordingly.

Once calculated the scores will be uploaded back into the student's folder as a text and each student could check their scores from google drive.

The teacher could verify and calculate all the students one by one, after all the students are done then the final scores of all the students are uploaded to google drive as a spreadsheet and can be downloaded
